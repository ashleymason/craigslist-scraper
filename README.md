# Craigslist Apartment Info Scraper

_A small tool for scraping apartment info from Craigslist ads._

***

This app was written with Cloud9 text editor. It is a work-in-progress. 

If possible, I would suggest using Cloud9 to view it. It's free!

***

To use this application: 
  * copy the repo from Github down to your preferred text editor
  * run bundle install
  * run rake db:migrate
  * start your server
  * launch the app in your local browser (you can use the 'preview' function if you clone this repo in Cloud9)

When you preview the app in your browser, you should automatically be pointed to the listings index.
There you will see a list of the 120 most recent craigslist apartment listings in RDU, including
the title, price, and date they were posted. 

Thanks for looking!
